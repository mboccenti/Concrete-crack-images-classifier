## Concrete crack images classifier - Capstone project

# About this Course
In this capstone, learners will apply their deep learning knowledge and expertise to a real world challenge.  They will use a library of their choice to develop and test a deep learning model. They will load and pre-process data for a real problem, build the model and validate it. Learners  will then present a project report to demonstrate the validity of their model and their proficiency in the field of Deep Learning.
# Learning Outcomes:
- determine what kind of deep learning method to use in which situation
- know how to build a deep learning model to solve a real problem 
- master the process of creating  a deep learning pipeline 
- apply knowledge of deep learning to improve models using real data
- demonstrate ability to present and communicate outcomes of deep learning projects
